Complete source code for the demo "isolated, in sunlight" by Traction and Brainstorm released at Revision 2020. 

To build it, you need some version of FreeType2 installed inside your Visual Studio include directory. Sorry about that. Originally built with VS 2015, but it has been succesfully compiled also on VS 2022. Some adjustment might be necessary. Other people's code used include GLM, GLFW, GLEW and maybe some other various bits as well. Enjoy.
